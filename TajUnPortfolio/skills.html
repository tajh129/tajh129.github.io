                <h1>My Skills</h1>
                <h2>Professional</h2>
                <p>
                    In terms of basic skills I can use in both school and work-related tasks, I'm quite good at organizationa and am a quick learner.
                    I follow orders given and am not afraid to ask questions. When it comes to more specific skills though, I'm pretty decent at coding in
                    languages like HTML, and can be very professional with my grammar. I'm also really efficient when I'm working late at night. That's
                    as much as I can think of for my professional skills, as my personal skills are a lot more interesting.
                </p>
                <h2><br>Personal</h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of writing it out in a short paragraph like I did with the other section, I'm gonna talk about some different and notable skills
                    I have in chunks.
                </p>
                <h3><br>Skill Level</h3>
                <p>
                    Firstly, I'm quite skilled in basically any game I play. I can quickly learn a game to become at least decent at it within a short timespan,
                    with some games I end up being really good at immediately, or end up just playing long enough to reach that level. I'm nowhere near the top
                    of any game I play, but I'm at least above average in most of them.
                </p>
                <h3><br>Coding/Modding</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, coding is also here as a personal skill. Why? Because I code for some games that I play to create mods. The one I'm most adept in is JSON
                    for Minecraft. More specifically, there's a mod called Origins that lets users esentially make classes/races they can choose to have certain
                    powers and abilities. I have made a ton of those for myself and my friends to use. Another thing I mod from time to time is a game called
                    Chrono Ark, which is a roguelike with a cast of characters you can make a party with for your run. I have modded in a couple characters for
                    that game as well. There's also other games I mod, but that's more of just replacing an image or something so i don't count that as much.
                </p>
                <h3><br>Luck</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes, luck is a skill and I'm quite adept in it. My luck isn't so ridiculously good that I've won the lottery(at least not yet), but my luck is
                    definitely above average. My luck can also be slightly manipulated. While it doesn't seem like this should be possible, it's not a power I can
                    control, it's just the equivalent to like karma for my luck. For instance, if something unlucky happens to me that I didn't really want, it usually
                    means that I'll get lucky for something else later, and vice versa. When compared to my friends especially, I'm the luckiest person in our group.
                </p>
                <h3><br>Bad Time Simulator</h3>
                <img class="image" src="images/sans-undertale.gif" alt="A GIF of Sans the Skeleton from Undertale">
                <p>
                    Okay this is one of my best skills, and it's just that I'm really good at Bad Time Simulator. I can basically just open it up at any time and beat Sans
                    first try. I just randomly do this sometimes, especially when I need to wait a few minutes for something. Sometimes I'll even fight Sans again just because.
                    I literally decided to beat him while making this page. A lot of people can't even beat Sans in multiple tries, so I think it's a pretty good skill to be able
                    to beat him in one. If you wanna try it out, go to <a href="https://jcw87.github.io/c2-sans-fight" target="_blank" class="p-link">Bad Time Simulator</a> here.
