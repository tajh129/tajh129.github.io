Well for the 2 people that don't know, it's a sandbox survival game, where creativity rules. I like playing this game a lot with friends because we can basically do whatever we want in this game. "

While this is one of my favourite games, one thing that makes it lose points is the fact that it only gets really fun when playing with a lot of friends, which is something I can't do often.",
            /*PEAK*/"I'm not a big fan of games that the gaming community now defines as \"friendslop\", but PEAK is one of the few games I enjoy a lot. It's ridiculously simple: Climb mountains, reach the PEAK, try not to die. The visuals are also really charming, and the players having proximity chat adds a lot of fun. "

Chrono Ark is a roguelike card game where you form a party of characters and build them throughout the run. The game also has an overarching story and an easy gamemode called Hope Mode for those who are "

I've made a couple of mods myself, and find it to be a really fun experience. I would have hundreds more hours on this game, but the thing that "
            + "keeps me from playing it more is the same thing I have with all roguelikes, which is that eventually it gets repetitive. One run is actually quite short, with a very linear path if you don't have mods. While this is one of the most fun games I play, it's a game I don't play as often as the others.",

Reverse: 1999 is a turn-based gacha game and my favourite game to date.

I know that sounds unhealthy and bad(because it is), but Reverse: 1999 is one of few gacha games that are extremely generous with free rewards, including their in-game currency. When I do spend actual money, unlike other gacha I've played I don't "

This game has some of the best and most emotional stories I've seen in any game, and the visuals of the game are extremely pleasing. All the character designs are so good, and each one actually has unique "
            + "personalities. The gameplay itself is also really fun, and unlike other gachas I've played it's way easier and more enjoyable building random lower tier characters when I'm bored. The OST is also one of my favourites out of every game I've played(I'm using one of their soundtracks for this page). There's too much for me to explain here, so all I'll say is go try it. It's fun.
