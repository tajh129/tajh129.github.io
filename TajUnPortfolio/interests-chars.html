            + "was also really fun. When I played, my team composition was built around him. His character is also just me: A guy who plays card games and likes puns.",
            /*Bianca*/"Bianca is a nurse at the Albright Clinic and the protagonist from the webcomic Clinic of Horrors. She shows very little emotion, but also shows she both cares and doesn't take anyone's shit. "

            /*Yuri*/"One of four pieces of a whole being known as Zarc, Yuri has three counterparts that look similar to him. While the other counterparts care about doing the right thing and helping others, Yuri is "
            + "a sadistic duelist who does what he wants and makes fun of those he finds weaker than him. You know a duel's gonna be good when Yuri's involved, and his Predplant deck is one of my favourite archetypes in Yu-Gi-Oh!",
            /*FP*/"Flutterpage(Real name Liberti) is an arcanist with the ability to control the wind, allowing her to float and fly freely. She was given the nickname 'Little Miss Why' due to her constant asking of questions "

            /*KamenX*/"Being the strongest blader in Beyblade X, Ekusu Kurosu, or Kamen X, has defeated multiple foes that threatened the current state of Beyblade. He's also part of the top team in the show, and is currently "
            + "still undefeated. Despite all this, Kamen X doesn't care about any of it. All he cares about is fighting strong bladers and having fun. His character is both extremely cool and extremely silly, as he'll go so far "

            /*Garnet*/"Being my favourite character ever, Garnet is and forever will be my main on Eternal Return. Her design is exactly my style, from the outfit to the colour scheme. Her kit is insanely fun, as characters that "
            + "fight using HP costs is my favourite gimmick, and being able to instakill someone with her ult is awesome. Her sadomasochist personality also adds so much to her character, with things like the Eternal Return webcomics "
