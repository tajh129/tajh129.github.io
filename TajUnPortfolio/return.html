                You're back! Did you have fun looking around? Or did you only go to like, one page and just come back here.
                I'm not judging. Unless you're that guy that I don't know that for some reason decided to stay on this site
                and look around. Like, you're weird dude, go do something else. We don't know each other, so why are you
                looking at this website? For those that actually have a reason to be on this website, I hope you learned
                more about me without me having to go through the trouble of talking about it IRL. And if you're reading this,
                you're probably wondering why this homepage dialogue is different. Well, that's a secret that you can probably
                figure out pretty quickly if you think about it for a little.
