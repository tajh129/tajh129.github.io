                    My name is Taj Hong, although Frosty is usually the name I go by online. The image above is the profile
                    picture I use on basically all of my personal accounts. I'm a big gamer and currently in college for my
                    Associate of Applied Science for Software Development. I also have a job, but I'm not telling you what
                    that is here because unless you work with me, I don't want you coming to my place of work and getting
                    me fired.
                    <br>The skills I've learned over the years mostly involve computers and coding, as I taught myself
                    how to code a few different things for games, while also learning how to code from school. I'm also a pretty
                    fast learner at basically everything, which allows me to be good at almost any game I play. If you want to
                    learn more, go to my <a href="skills.html" class="p-link">Skills</a> page.
                    <br>My interests and hobbies are almost exclusively gaming related. I play a wide variety of games ranging
                    from very relaxing games that allow me to chill and do nothing, all the way to the side of extremely stressful
                    games that force me to focus and be locked in. If you wanna know more about everything that I'm into, then go
                    to my <a href="interests.html" class="p-link">Skills</a> page.
                    <br><br><br><br><sup>(Also if you wanna see the friend that made my pfp then go <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_alem_art_" target="_blank" class="p-link">here</a>.)</sup>
